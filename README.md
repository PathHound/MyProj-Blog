# MyProj-Blog
Project for Code Louisville:
Nerd Blog by Partick England

To use the website is pretty basic.

• Navigation.
1- Select a year at the top, click or pick a month.
2- The post's will 'slide up' out of existence and slide down the appropriate post's for that month.

• New Content.
You should be able to add post's of your own, while they will not permanently be kept on the website after you reload, they will remain on the page while your browse the site and different area's of the webpage.

1- Add a Post title.
2- Add the Current date.
3- Add your content.
4- Click the post button and your content will be applied to the webpage until it reloads.

February has been setup to show random post's every time the website loads to try and simulate post's made by the writer based on his thoughts or an attempt to simulate some life.
